# DVSOD-Baseline
This repository provides the source code of DVSOD baseline.

## Installation 

The code requires `python>=3.7`, as well as `pytorch>=1.5` and `torchvision>=0.7`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended.

## Getting Started

First download the `DViSal` [dataset](https://github.com/DVSOD/DVSOD-DViSal). Then the model can be used in just a few adaptions to start training:

1. Set your `DViSal dataset path` and `ckpt save path` in `train.py`
2. Perform training, with ```python train.py```

Meanwhile, the saliency can be generated by loading [the model checkpoint](XXX), with:
1. Set your `DViSal dataset path` and `ckpt save path` in `test.py`
2. Specify the `ckpt name` and `testset name` in `test.py`
3. Perform inference, with ```python test.py```
